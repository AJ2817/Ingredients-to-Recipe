This would take another 10 minutes. The beans continue to cook under the pressure even when it is turned off.Once the pressure is released, open the cooker and drain out the excess liquids. You store this liquid and use it in the vegetable stock or risotto.Once the beans are cooked, our next step is to spice it up to make the baked beans.Heat oil in a sauce pan on medium heat; add in the onions and garlic and give it a light sauté until the onions are tender. Add the tomatoes, honey and the spices and give it a stir.Add in the cooked drained beans into the tomato gravy. Stir fry the beans until the beans get well coated with the tomatoes.

After an hour, wash the chopped bitter gourd thoroughly and keep aside to drain. Use a little oil and roast the bitter gourd rings on low heat in a kadai till crisp. Peel and clean the Ambade meanwhile when the bitter gourd is roasting on low heat. Heat a little oil in a kadai (a few drops each time) and lightly roast the coriander seeds, urad dal, methi seeds, rice grains, peppercorns, asafoetida piece and dry red chillies separately on low heat.As soon as each ingredient changes its colour, remove from flame and keep aside to cool.Once cooled, grind all these ingredients in a mixer grinder along with the grated coconut, using required water to form a smooth paste. Add to this paste to a cup of water and mix well to form a semi-thick gravy and pour in the kadai.Now, add turmeric powder, ambade/hog plum/amtekai, jaggery, roasted bitter gourd rings, salt to taste and keep on a high heat stirring occasionally till it reaches boiling point. Once it starts boiling, lower the heat and simmer for about 8-10 minutes or till the ambade are cooked and soft. If you feel that the gravy has thickened too much by now, just add some water to bring back a medium consistency which is desirable.Check for seasoning and adjust salt and jaggery if required. In a tadka pan, heat a bit of oil for tempering and when the oil is hot, add mustard seeds and asafoetida. Pour this over the prepared udid methi.Serve Karwar Style Ambade Udid Methi Recipe (Hog Plum Curry) along with Steamed Rice and Sol Kadhi for a South Indian meal.</td>\n","      <td id=\"T_c70c6_row2_col10\" class=\"data row2 col10\" >85</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th id=\"T_c70c6_level0_row3\" class=\"row_heading level0 row3\" >3</th>\n","      <td id=\"T_c70c6_row3_col0\" class=\"data row3 col0\" >Chettinad Style Prawn Biryani Recipe</td>\n","      <td id=\"T_c70c6_row3_col1\" class=\"data row3 col1\" >Non Vegeterian</td>\n","      <td id=\"T_c70c6_row3_col2\" class=\"data row3 col2\" >Chettinad</td>\n","      <td id=\"T_c70c6_row3_col3\" class=\"data row3 col3\" >Lunch</td>\n","      <td id=\"T_c70c6_row3_col4\" class=\"data row3 col4\" >200 grams Shrimps - or prawns,1-1/2 cups Basmati rice,4-5 Shallots,1 tablespoon Ginger - paste,1 tablespoon Garlic - paste,3 tablespoons Fresh coconut - grated,1 teaspoon Green Chilli - paste,1/2 cup Hung Curd (Greek Yogurt),2 sprig Curry leaves,1 cup Sunflower Oil,2 tablespoons Ghee,1 teaspoon Coriander Powder (Dhania),1 teaspoon Red Chilli powder,1/2 teaspoon Turmeric powder (Haldi),1 teaspoon Garam masala powder,5-6 Whole Black Peppercorns,4 Cardamom (Elaichi) Pods/Seeds,2 Black cardamom (Badi Elaichi),1 inch Cinnamon Stick (Dalchini),2 Bay leaves (tej patta),2-3 Dry Red Chilli,1/2 teaspoon Cumin seeds (Jeera)</td>\n","      <td id=\"T_c70c6_row3_col5\" class=\"data row3 col5\" >30</td>\n","      <td id=\"T_c70c6_row3_col6\" class=\"data row3 col6\" >25</td>\n","      <td id=\"T_c70c6_row3_col7\" class=\"data row3 col7\" >55</td>\n","      <td id=\"T_c70c6_row3_col8\" class=\"data row3 col8\" >4</td>\n","      <td id=\"T_c70c6_row3_col9\" class=\"data row3 col9\" >To prepare Chettinad Style Prawn Biryani Recipe, wash and clean prawns well, collect in a bowl and add ginger garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric, few drops of lemon juice and 2-3 pinch salt.

Keep this mixture in a wide plate to become cool.The next step is to make the outer shell for the Puli. Soak Chire or Poha or flat beaten rice into a bowl of water for 2 to 3 minutes, then wash the chire or poha properly and drain the water through a colander.Add chire or poha, maida and sooji in a bowl, make a soft dough by adding milk gradually. Now make lemon sized balls from the dough. Flatten each ball with your fingers then a make a bowl by pressing down the middle section in.Do not make it very thick or thin. The shell would be medium thin. Add small amount of jaggery coconut mixture into it.Bring together both the edges, then press and seal with your finger. Make other pulis the same way.To make the kheer, add milk for Kheer in a big heavy bottomed pan on medium flame. Once it starts to boil, switch the heat to low and cook for another 5 minutes. Then remove the pan from the heat, add the required jaggery and mix, then place the pan back on the heat again and let it be cook on low flame.Adding jaggery into the milk in this way will prevent the milk to be curdled.
